# Day-planner
//Here I have made a dayplanner in which you can use as a daily schedule to help organize your day!
You can put infomation in each time block of your work day, and save hit by hitting the blue button.
I've found it can help to stay focused better during my day and help me maximize productivty. 
This day planner will show you by color variation if the time is in the present(red), past(gray),
or future(green). This can help in quickly identifing where you are in the day, so you know the task
or objective that needs to get done in this time block. At the top of the page you will find the time, 
just in case you may have forgetten you watch. I think this will effectivly increase your productivity in
your day to day work routine.
